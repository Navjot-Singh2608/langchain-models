This project explores how to integrate popular models like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Generative AI, and Hugging Face chat and embedding models to build intelligent AI pipelines and semantic search applications.

📌 Features
✅ Integration with multiple ChatModels:

ChatOpenAI

ChatAnthropic

ChatGoogleGenerativeAI

ChatHuggingFace (via langchain_huggingface)

HuggingFaceEndpoint

🔍 Embedding models for Semantic Search:

HuggingFaceEmbeddings with sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

🧠 Use of .env and dotenv for secure API key management
